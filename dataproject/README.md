# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project: Sustainable Returns** and is an analysis that investigates the relationship between fifteen Danish companies' ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) score and the fluctuations in their stocks' prices on a monthly basis.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Companies ESG scores.csv (*source*)
2. Monthly prices.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
