    "The Malthusian Growth Model is a model of population growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a model where time is discrete, t=0,1,2,...,$\\infty$. The economy is closed meaning that total production is equal to total income. There are three main assumptions to the Malthusain model. The first assumption is that labour is subject to diminishing marginal returns in production, which is represented in the model as the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_t=L_t^{1-\\alpha}(AX)^\\alpha, 0 < \\alpha < 1$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where t denotes time, t=0,1,2.., $Y_t$ denotes output, A is the level of techonology, $L_t$ is labor input and X is land (fixed factor of production). Output per worker can we written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_t=(\\frac{AX}{L_t})^\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation shows that output per worker declines as labor (L) increases due to the assumption of deminishing returns, given that AX is constant. In our model we will assume that the level of technology (A) and land (X) is constant. The assumption of A being constant will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next main assumption of the Malthusian model is that the birth rate in the economy increases with income per capita, which is shown in this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$n_t=\\eta y_t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is a positive parameter. This equation implies that every person in the economy gets $n_t$ children in each period. We further assume that the preferable number of children increases with income per capita. With this assumption it would be reasonable to think of $\\eta$ as a parameter below one, where each parent in the economy uses a fixed fraction of their income to provide for their children (food, clothes, etc.). We can thus interpret $\\eta$ as a parameter capturing preferences for family size and cost of child rearing etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we assume that everyone in the economy works, meaning no unemployment. We then assume that the labor force ($L_t$) evolves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L_{t+1}=n_tL_t+(1-\\mu)L_t, L_0$ given.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equations implies that the labor force in the next period ($L_{t+1}$) is equal to the current labor force ($L_t$) times births per person ($n_t$), plus the part of the current labor force, which is still in the labor force (the fraction $(1-\\mu)$). Assuming that people work intil they die, we can think of $\\mu$ as the mortality rate, where a higher $\\mu$ means higher mortality."
