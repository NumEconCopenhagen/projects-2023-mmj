# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Malthusian Growth Model** and is about how said model works. In this project we investigate the mechanisms of the two main components, namely population size and output per worker is derived under the model's assumptions. Then we look at how these react and adapt to changes to the technological level (for different parameter values) by simulating.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
